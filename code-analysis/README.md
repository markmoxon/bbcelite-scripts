# Code analaysis scripts for the bbcelite.com website and associated repositories

This folder contains a number of scripts that I use to manage the content in my source code repositories and websites.

## Code images

The [code-images] folder contains a script to generate visual images that contain the binaries from my disassembly projects. To run the script, change directory into [code-images] and run the script like this:

```
cd code-images
python image.py
```

This will generate PNG images of the assembled binaries in the source code repositories.

Right on, Commanders!
